# Iris

## Overview

Iris is a modern C++20 engine designed for asynchronous ingestion and processing of endurance training data stored in Garmin FIT files.

The project focuses on building a clean, explicit concurrency model using C++20 coroutines, asynchronous I/O, and a structured data processing pipeline.

The initial scope of the project is offline processing of locally stored FIT files, with the possibility to support future integration with remote data sources such as Garmin Connect.
